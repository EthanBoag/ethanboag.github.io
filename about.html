    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Tri-Sphere Training is based on the belief that complete athletes are developed through the integration of three key spheres: mental, physical, and emotional. These overlapping areas represent our commitment to fostering balance and strength across every aspect of the game. We teach athletes to push their limits physically, build mental resilience, and stay emotionally grounded â€” forming a well-rounded, confident player ready for any challenge.</p>
